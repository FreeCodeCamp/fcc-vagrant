#LIST OF THINGS

###Short Term
- Update the README.md
- Create 'fccuser' that is in group sudoers [Not working]

###Mid Term
- Install linuxbrew under 'fccuser'
- Install node as 'fccuser'

###Long Term
- Clone FCC repo to /home/fccuser/developer/freecodecamp
- Set the share/swap directory as easily configurable by the user (if they have a local fork to keep the vagrant freecodecamp pointed at their local file system)
- Profit?

###BONUS
- Set up mongo to listen to an ip other than localhost on a port other than 27017.

####NOTES
- must have hostmanager vagrant plugin installed (add to readme)
